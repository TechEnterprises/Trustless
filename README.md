# Trustless Token Management

Token Management for Humans. 

Trustless Token Management provides an Ethereum blockchain user an automated interface for minting, monitoring, modifying and marketing any number of approved tokens. 

## Token Templates

Trustless Token Templates are slated to always be derived from EIP #20 Standard Tokens. 

## Token Registry

Trustless Token Registry is slated to always be derived from EIP #22 Standard Token Registries. They are deployed to the blockchain and are built to accomodate calls from the Token Factory to accomodate passive updating. 

Tokens not created by a registered Token Factory directly but which are built from Trustless Token Templates can manually register by way of formal bytecote pattern validation (expensive).

A Top-level Token Registry may also be deployed to build essentially a registry of registries.

## Token Factory

Trustless Token Factory is built to be deployed to the blockchain and will be one of the services which can be easily managed via a graphical user interface. 

We forsee Tokens to ultimately act as a binary resource to be used in custom non-binary arrays. (Do you have this token and 100 of those tokens?) Tokens and 'token structs' would henseforth be used to fulfill a diverse set of various requirements including but not limited to assigning permissions, recognizing achievements or even storing value. This is the early relational database capability. For this reason our factory will ascribe Create, Read, Update and Destroy methods to deploy their tokens.  

## Token Accounting

Trustless Token Accounting deploys a managed Top-level Token Registry for users to report from any number of registries, monitoring every assortment of tokens, and and accessing all of their registered available functions.
