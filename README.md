# Trustless Token Management Information System (TTMIS)

Token Management for Humans. 

Trustless Token Management provides an Ethereum blockchain user an automated interface for minting, monitoring, or manipulating any number of approved tokens. 

## Token Templates

Trustless Token Templates include libraries and components slated to build tokens derived from EIP #20 Standard Tokens beginning with Token.sol. This is in the form of open source code initially managed at github and heavily adopts and seeks to align with ConsenSys' development methodology therefore favoring truffle.

## Token Registry

Trustless Token Registry is slated to always be derived from EIP #22 Standard Token Registries. They are deployed to the blockchain and are built to passively manage calls from the Token Factory to accomodate automatic updating. 

Tokens not created by a registered Token Factory but are built to specification may be post-registered by way of formal bytecote pattern validation (expensive).

A Top-level Token Registry may also be deployed to essentially manage a registry of registries.

## Token Factory

Trustless Token Factory is built to be deployed to the blockchain and will be one of the services which can be easily managed via a graphical user interface. 

Tokens will ultimately act as a binary resource to be used in custom non-binary arrays. (Do you have this token and 100 of those tokens?) Tokens and 'token structs' would henseforth be used to fulfill a diverse set of various requirements including but not limited to assigning permissions, recognizing achievements or even storing value. 

With strategic use of standard functions we forsee early relational database capability. For this reason our factory will consider Create, Read, Update and Destroy methods upon deployment of their tokens.  

## Token Accounting

Trustless Token Accounting deploys a managed Top-level Token Registry to report on any number of registries, monitor every assortment of tokens, and access their registered available functions. 

## Token Wallet

Trustless Token Wallet is a GUI (graphical user interface) which offer intuitive human interaction with the Token Accounting, Token Factory and Token Trading functions.

## Token Trading

Trustless Token Trading (TTT) will allow Calls and Puts to be made as well as offer personal value rating systems for the tokens held in managed accounts. Essentially tokens you are placing to the market will be the preferred tokens spent and the tokens you are looking to buy become the tokens you prefer to recieve for services.
